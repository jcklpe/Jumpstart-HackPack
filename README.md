# JumpstartHackathons
Organizations are like a city, filled with homes and businesses. These businesses and homes need good infrastructure to be productive. Roads that connect them, and telephone lines that help people communicate. Tech companies often know how to do this cheaply and quickly using standardized processes and technology. Non-profits and civic organizations however are often left behind. The purpose of this Hack-Pack is:

1. Empower civic organizations to use advances in communication technology.
2. Help tech and non-tech people communicate efficiently. 
3. Document this information and provide a distributable, community system for other organizations to use and contribute to, in the spirit of OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.

**Status of the project**
I've been learning a ton and I'm finally finally coming to a point where I can meaningfully contribute to this project. Basically the last year and a half has been me relearning and relearning better ways of doing things and I think I'm finally hitting a nice steady state where I can actually document my stable processes.
